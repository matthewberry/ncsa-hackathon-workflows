# Hackathon Starter Workflows
 A collection of example workflows to kickstart hackathon projects.

 1. Enron dataset task
 - Enron email dataset in kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset/data . 1.5GB dataset. Not a very clean dataset
 - Parse and clean dataset
 - Tasks :
   * Get the count of user sent emails per year and plot it
   * NetworkX graph from emails
   * RAG pipeline
   * Find the most important person and summarize all the emails

  2. Letterbox dataset
     - Letterboxd dataset is a more cleaner and elaborate IMDb dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gsimonx37/letterboxd/data
     - Has posters (image data) and multiple csv tabular data
     - Can devise some tasks that might combine multiple data?

3. Kaggle dataset for computer vision
   - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?tags=13207-Computer+Vision
   - Can pick one task. These datasets will need some preprocessing.

4. Astronomical Image processing workflow
   - Most astronomical deep-sky imagery needs some processing.
   - Multiple images, filters, denoising.
   - Pixinsight is a software that people use to process FITS images https://pixinsight.com/
   - A youtube video on the workflow using Wolfram Language https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwnJubCJu-Q

5. DocVQA
   - massive dataset of visual docs for QA. https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=17&com=introduction
   - Can define some tasks based on this dataset
